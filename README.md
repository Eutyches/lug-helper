**Star Citizen's Linux Users Group Helper Script**

https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/LUG

*Greetings, fellow Penguin!*

This script is designed to help you optimize your system to run Star Citizen as smoothly as possible. It presents options to check your system for optimal settings and helps you change them as needed to prevent game crashes.

It also includes an easy way for you to wipe your `USER` folder as is recommended after major version updates. It will back up your exported keybinds, delete your `USER` folder, then restore your keybinds.

To export your keybinds from within the game, go to:
`Options->Keybindings->Control Profiles->Save Control Settings`
